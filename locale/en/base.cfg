[mod-setting-description]
resource-labels-schedule-interval=The resource labeling algorithm scans all charted chunks for resources. This interval determines how many ticks should pass between each chunk scan.\n\nHigher values increase performance, but it takes longer to show all resource labels.\n\nDefault: 20, Minimum: 0 (not recommended)
resource-labels-show-labels=If checked, display the resource name next to the resource icon.\n\nDefault: true
resource-labels-cooldown=The cooldown time in ticks that has to pass before players of a force can calculate labels again. This setting is mainly for server admins to prevent players from lagging the server.\n\nDefault: 60, Minimum: 0
resource-labels-show-resource-count=If checked, show the resource count next to the resource icon.\n\nDefault: false
resource-labels-show-infinite-ores=If checked, infinite ores will also be labeled.\n\nDefault: true
resource-labels-minimum-resource-count=The minimum amount of resources a connected resource patch needs to have to be considered for labeling. This setting can be used to prevent resource labels from being put on fragmented ore patches (i.e. when the original ore patch has been mostly mined).\n\nOnly works for finite resources.\n\nDefault: 0, Minimum: 0
resource-labels-minimum-resource-entity-count=The minimum size of a resource patch. Resource patches equal to or smaller than this value are not labeled. This setting can be used to prevent resource labels from being put on fragmented ore patches (i.e. when the original ore patch has been mostly mined).\n\nOnly works for ores.\n\nDefault: 10, Minimum: 0
resource-labels-show-unknown-entity-msg=If checked, a message will be displayed whenever this mod finds an unknown (not configured) resource entity.\n\nDefault: true
